# colorchanger_CSSMediaQuery

**Media queries** are used to modify the site or app depending on a device's general type (such as print vs. screen) or specific characteristics and parameters (such as screen resolution or browser viewport width). They are used to check many things, such as:

- width and height of the viewport
- width and height of the device
- orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode)
- resolution

They are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet (responsive web design) to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.

So, I decided to learn basic queries by making a small project, where I made a responsive page which changes it's color depending on the size of the screen. I followed this article posted on **freecodecamp** by Joy Shaheb https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-css-media-queries-by-building-projects/.  You can even watch his video to understand it better https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HY8q4TD3KGM&t=153s.
